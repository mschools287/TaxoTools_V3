Description: TaxoTools is an R package designed to streamline the process of taxonomic research and phylogenetic analysis. It provides a suite of tools for generating species descriptions, summarizing morphological traits, and comparing phylogenetic trees. With specialized functions for handling Maximum Likelihood, Bayesian, and time-calibrated phylogenies, the package simplifies tasks such as node annotation, support value summarization, and tree plotting. Additional features include morphology-based diagnostics, geographic range mapping, and data-driven appendices for monographs. Whether you're describing new species, analyzing morphological traits, or synthesizing phylogenetic datasets, TaxoTools enhances efficiency and reproducibility for researchers in taxonomy, systematics, and biodiversity science.
